- ProcessDate (char(8)): The date the transaction was processed, in YYYYMMDD format.
- ItemType (smallint): A numeric code for the document type. the ItemType refers as follows : 0 = 'Cheque', 1 = 'Stub' , 8 ='Envelope' , 9 = 'Correspondences"
- Amount (money): The monetary value of this single transaction.
- CheckNbr (bigint): The check number for this transaction.
- AcctNo (varchar(50)): The account number associated with the transaction.
- RTNo (varchar(20)): The bank routing number associated with the transaction.
- TranNo (int): The transaction number. **CRITICAL: Multiple items (rows) can belong to a single transaction.** All rows with the same TranNo are part of the same transaction. To count the number of unique transactions, you MUST use COUNT(DISTINCT TranNo).
- Reject (smallint): A flag indicating if the transaction was rejected. 0 = accepted/unrejected, 1 = rejected.
- RejectReason (smallint, foreign key): A numeric code for the rejection reason. This links to the RejectReasons table.
- RejectPgm (smallint, foreign key): The 'program ID' part of the rejection reason. Use this along with RejectReason to join to the REJREASON table.
- RejectUsercode (varchar): The user who marked the item as rejected.
- WorkSrc (varchar, foreign key): The work source code for this item. This is used to find the WSIdx from the WorkSrcDesc table, which is needed to find the rejection reason.

Table: PSGTMS.BATCHFILE
Description: Contains a summary record for each batch. **This table is the ONLY source for counting ACCEPTED items.**
Columns:
- SiteId (smallint, primary key): The ID of the site where the batch was processed.
- BatchMode (smallint, foreign key): A numeric code for the processing mode of the batch. This links to the TDF_BatchModes table to get the mode description (BatchModeDesc).
    - BatchNo (char(10), primary key): The unique number for this batch. This is used to link to the individual transactions in the DetailFile tables.
- ProcessDate (char(8)): The date the batch was processed, likely in YYYYMMDD format. Use this for questions about "today", "yesterday", or specific dates.
- WorkDate (char(8)): The date the work was performed, in YYYYMMDD format.
- StartTime (char(6)): The time the batch processing started, likely in HHMMSS format.
- EndTime (char(6)): The time the batch processing finished.
- CheckCount (smallint): The final count of *accepted* check items in the batch after rejections.**ALWAYS use this column to count accepted checks.**
- StubCount (smallint): The final count of *accepted* stub items in the batch after rejections.**ALWAYS use this column to count accepted stubs.**
- TotalTrans (smallint): The final, updated count of all accepted items in the batch. **Use SUM(TotalTrans) to get the total number of transactions.**
- CheckTotal (money): The total monetary value of all checks in this batch.
- StubTotal (money): The total monetary value of all stubs in this batch.
- BatchValue (int, foreign key): A numeric code representing the current status of the batch. This links to the TDF_BatchValues table to get the status description (BatchValueDesc).

Table: PSGTMS.REJREASON
Description: A lookup table for transaction rejection reasons. JOIN with DetailFile1 on RejectReason to find out why a transaction failed.
Columns:
- PgmID (int, primary key): The program ID component of the reason code. Used to join with DetailFile1.RejectPgm.
- RejID (int, primary key): The rejection ID component of the reason code. Used to join with DetailFile1.RejectReason.
- RejDesc (varchar): The text description of why an item was rejected (e.g., 'Invalid Amount', 'Signature Missing').
- WSIdx (int, primary key): The Work Source Index. This is the final part of the key. A value of 0 is a generic, default reason.
