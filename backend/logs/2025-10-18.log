Table: PSGTMS.REJREASON
Description: A lookup table for transaction rejection reasons. JOIN with DetailFile1 on RejectReason to find out why a transaction failed.
Columns:
- PgmID (int, primary key): The program ID component of the reason code. Used to join with DetailFile1.RejectPgm.
- RejID (int, primary key): The rejection ID component of the reason code. Used to join with DetailFile1.RejectReason.
- RejDesc (varchar): The text description of why an item was rejected (e.g., 'Invalid Amount', 'Signature Missing').
- WSIdx (int, primary key): The Work Source Index. This is the final part of the key. A value of 0 is a generic, default reason.
---
Table: PSGTMS.DetailFile1
Description: Contains a record for every individual transaction item. **This table shows the CURRENT state of a transaction. For the HISTORY of changes, you MUST use the PSGAuditStats tables.**
Columns:
- DetailKey (bigint, primary key): A unique key for this transaction.
- BatchNo (char(10), foreign key): Links the transaction back to the BATCHFILE table.
- SeqNo (int): The sequence number of this transaction within its batch.
- ProcessDate (char(8)): The date the transaction was processed, in YYYYMMDD format.
- ItemType (smallint): A numeric code for the document type. the ItemType refers as follows : 0 = 'Cheque', 1 = 'Stub' , 8 ='Envelope' , 9 = 'Correspondences"
- Amount (money): The monetary value of this single transaction.
- CheckNbr (bigint): The check number for this transaction.
- AcctNo (varchar(50)): The account number associated with the transaction.
- RTNo (varchar(20)): The bank routing number associated with the transaction.
- TranNo (int): The transaction number. **CRITICAL: Multiple items (rows) can belong to a single transaction.** All rows with the same TranNo are part of the same transaction. To count the number of unique transactions, you MUST use COUNT(DISTINCT TranNo).
- Reject (smallint): A flag indicating if the transaction was rejected. 0 = accepted/unrejected, 1 = rejected.
- RejectReason (smallint, foreign key): A numeric code for the rejection reason. This links to the RejectReasons table.
- RejectPgm (smallint, foreign key): The 'program ID' part of the rejection reason. Use this along with RejectReason to join to the REJREASON table.
- RejectUsercode (varchar): The user who marked the item as rejected.
- WorkSrc (varchar, foreign key): The work source code for this item. This is used to find the WSIdx from the WorkSrcDesc table, which is needed to find the rejection reason.

Table: PSGTMS.REJREASON
Description: A lookup table for transaction rejection reasons. Finding the correct reason requires a complex join with DetailFile1 and WorkSrcDesc. Its full name is PSGTMS.REJREASON.
Columns:
- PgmID (int, primary key): The program ID component. Joins with DetailFile1.RejectPgm.
- RejID (int, primary key): The rejection ID component. Joins with DetailFile1.RejectReason.

- Reject (smallint): A flag indicating if the transaction was rejected. 0 = accepted/unrejected, 1 = rejected.
- RejectPgm (smallint, foreign key): The 'program ID' part of the rejection reason. This is used with RejectReason and WorkSrc to join to the REJREASON table.
- RejectReason (smallint, foreign key): The 'rejection ID' part of the rejection reason. This is used with RejectPgm and WorkSrc to join to the REJREASON table.
- WorkSrc (varchar, foreign key): The work source code. This is used to join with the WorkSrcDesc table to find the WSIdx needed for the rejection reason.

- ItemType (smallint): A numeric code for the document type. Examples: 0 = 'Cheque', 1 = 'Stub', 8 = 'Envelope'.
- Amount (money): The monetary value of this single transaction.
- Reject (smallint): A flag indicating if the transaction was rejected. 0 = accepted/unrejected, 1 = rejected.
- RejectPgm (smallint, foreign key): The 'program ID' part of the rejection reason. This is used with RejectReason and WorkSrc to join to the REJREASON table.
- RejectReason (smallint, foreign key): The 'rejection ID' part of the rejection reason. This is used with RejectPgm and WorkSrc to join to the REJREASON table.
- WorkSrc (varchar, foreign key): The work source code. This is used to join with the WorkSrcDesc table to find the WSIdx needed for the rejection reason.
